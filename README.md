What is this?

This is a simple C# application to show a [Pomodoro][pomodoro] timer in the Windows system tray.

How do I use it?
----------------
All actions are done by right-clicking the system tray icon, which shows a context menu.

To start a "Pomodoro" (25 minute timer), click the "Start Pomodoro" menu item.

To start a "short break" (5 minute timer), click the "Start short break" menu item.

To start a "long break" (15 minute timer), click the "Start long break" menu item.

Once you start a timer, the system tray icon will update to show how much time is remaining. Once
time expires, a "Time's Up!" message box will appear.

While the timer is running, you can pause or stop the timer with the appropriate menu items.

What else should I know?
------------------------
The message box that opens may not open in front of what you're working on, and so you might not see it.
